The libraries that this project depends on include:
pandas； torch； sklearn.preprocessing; sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split; torch.nn; matplotlib.pyplot; sys

According to the article, this project uses two different data processing methods to explore the performance of "Casper" and ordinary two-layer neural networks.

Run Approach 1 Casper & SimpleNN.py to use the first approach.

Run Approach 2 Casper & SimpleNN.py to use the second approach.

After each .py file is run, the results of the run will be saved in one. txt file.

Each .py file contains a data processing process and two models, which will be run in sequence using the same data.

The first approach works better.

p412-chen.pdf is a data introduction article.

CASPER_1-fixed.pdf is a technical introduction article.

Anger.xlsx is the original dataset, it will be read in by the program as a whole for processing.
